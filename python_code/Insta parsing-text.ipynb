He went a step ahead and appropriated the choice of song to the slogan of the present \\u2013 \\u2018Stay Home\\u2019!

Devotion and love are two sides of the same coin which finally lead to a divine surrender and this is what Bhavajan (Kumar) brought to us. The keertanam was a devotee\\u2019s celebration of the Lord\\u2019s magic from which he travelled down a path of love and pain through the Ashtapadi.
