  "synopsis": "We are sure you will all agree that expression/communication is the ultimate goal of mankind and the arts is the most creative avenue for that expression of life, in a sense.\n It has been exactly 24 hours since we presented Through his Lens, a marathon of abhinaya with 8 eminent male artistes and we are still reeling from that magic the artistes created on screen - we mean insta live :) Vaibhav Arekar set off our festival with an ode to lord shiva and segued into a very popular song on Lord Krishna but handled it in a reflective, introspective way. Krishna Nee Beganae Baaro, unlike the usual love of a mother that we are often used to seeing, came alive as a search for the warmth of a child\u2019s innocence. Christopher (Gurusamy) lead the way thereon from conventional to contemporary in terms of thought and music. A bold Javali where the nayika (heroine) shuns away the judgements of society. We also loved how he travelled from the bold to the broken featuring a lovelorn Radha and came back to the modern world with a Javali that has lyrics written in both Telugu and English \u2013 truly one-of-its-kind. The contemporary in the classic was further enhanced by Praveen Kumar who identified a very traditional piece that captures the the relationship between Krishna and Yashodha and viewed it from an entirely male perspective. He went a step ahead and appropriated the choice of song to the slogan of the present \u2013 \u2018Stay Home\u2019! Kasi (Aysola) took us through a linguistic journey choosing a song in Telugu, Tamil and Hindi and establishing how the shades of abhinaya can change with the change of language. Shijith (Nambiar) set out the mood to be rather romantic and took us through a myriad of emotions where he questioned, loved and finally surrendered. Devotion and love are two sides of the same coin which finally lead to a divine surrender and this is what Bhavajan (Kumar) brought to us. The keertanam was a devotee\u2019s celebration of the Lord\u2019s magic from which he travelled down a path of love and pain through the Ashtapadi. Parshwanath (Upadhye) created a surreal aura through his music and dance which he performed simultaneously. Contd in comments"

  "synopsis": "Because sometimes, we forget to say thank you that is befitting enough for the generosity with which artistes share and showcase their arts! We at Aalaap thoroughly enjoyed presenting this series which was a deep dive of sorts into specific ideas - ragams, language and poetry - by a bunch of women - all of whom we admire - and a young talent from Austin Texas, Vishaal Sapuram, who also came on board with the same spontaneity that these gorgeous women did when we sounded them off this idea. We enjoyed listening to Kaapi as much as we did the joyous Sankarabharanam; we hummed along and celebrated the aesthetic Reeti Gowlai and we had goosebumps when we heard Desh; we discovered the many facets of Mukhari and travelled along the landscape of language and finally signed off with the power of poetry that has a quality of strength, pathos, rawness, and an unwashed sense of vulnerability. We loved it and we thought we must say Thank You for the Music! Stay with us as we help you cope this lockdown and together, let\u2019s distract ourselves and soak in the arts! @murali.amritha @vidhyaraghavan @sriranjaninsta @nisha.rajagopalan @bharathiramasubban @sushmasaurus #hopeinthetimeofcorona #music #gratitude"

Titled literally as a drawing room conversation between these two icons, and moderated by Sushma, we are certain this is a session you just don\u2019t want to miss! Incidentally, we got featured in The Hindu so it was a sweet recognition of the work we\u2019ve been attempting to do under the umbrella of Hope in the Time of Corona!

It\u2019s a marathon session curated for a marathon generation with distraction and a short attention span but it\u2019s an earnest attempt to see how we can still make a difference in letting you access the arts a little better, a little deeper! \nThank you to the artistes!
